        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple
          developers to collaborate on a project without overwriting each
          other's changes.
        </p>
        <div class="more-text">
          <p>
            Git tracks changes in the source code, enabling you to revert to
            earlier versions and manage different versions of the code. It's a
            powerful tool for both solo developers and teams.

        <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git helps developers keep track of changes in code, enabling efficient
          collaboration and minimizing conflicts.
        </p>
        <div class="more-text">
          <p>
            With Git, developers can work on different features or fixes
            simultaneously, merge their changes, and avoid overwriting each
            other's work. This makes Git essential for any team project.

      <article class="third-article">
        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate version of your project where developers
          can work on new features without affecting the main codebase.
        </p>
        <div class="more-text">
          <p>
            Branches allow developers to experiment, fix bugs, or build
            features, then merge those changes back into the main project when
            they’re ready. This makes Git an invaluable tool for version control
            and collaboration.
